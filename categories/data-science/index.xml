      <description>A/B testing is a standard method of measuring the effect of changes by randomly assigning testing units to different groups. Randomization is key to A/B testing because it minimizes the chances that other factors will affect your result on average. A typical practice in A/B testing is to treat users as testing units, i.e. randomly assign users to control group (A) to treatment group (B) and perform hypothesis testing between</description>

      <description>In the tech industry, we use controlled experiments to learn and make decisions at every step of product development, from design to algorithms. When the experiment is about a single change, such as changing the layout of the UI or using a different machine learning algorithm, the methodology is often called A/B testing. While is all fashionable and new to use A/B testing, the technique behind the scene, hypothesis testing,</description>
